### Total Estimated Timeline: 19 weeks

## Dependencies and Critical Path

1. Project setup must be completed before database models
2. Core models must be implemented before core functionality
3. Authentication must be set up before implementing protected views
4. Google API integration depends on authentication being complete
5. Frontend implementation can begin in parallel with core functionality
6. Testing should be ongoing throughout development
7. Performance optimization should follow core functionality completion
8. Deployment preparation begins after all core features are implemented
9. Final testing must be completed before launch

## Risk Management

### Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

1. **Google API Changes**
   - Monitor API announcements
   - Implement version-specific API calls
   - Create fallback mechanisms

2. **Database Performance Issues**
   - Regular performance testing with realistic data volumes
   - Implement query optimization early
   - Plan for database scaling if needed

3. **Authentication Integration Challenges**
   - Allocate extra time for Firebase/Google OAuth integration
   - Create detailed authentication flow documentation
   - Implement thorough testing of all authentication paths

4. **Timeline Slippage**
   - Build buffer time into critical path items
   - Identify non-essential features that could be deferred
   - Regular progress tracking and adjustment

5. **Deployment Complications**
   - Create detailed deployment runbooks
   - Test deployment process in staging environment
   - Prepare rollback procedures
