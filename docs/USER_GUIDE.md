## Frequently Asked Questions

### General System Questions

**Q: What is Mobilize CRM designed for?**
A: Mobilize CRM is specifically designed for non-profit organizations, churches, and missionary organizations to manage relationships with individuals (people) and organizations (churches) through customizable pipeline stages. It tracks the progression of relationships from initial contact through long-term engagement.

**Q: Do I need to create a separate account for Mobilize CRM?**
A: No, Mobilize CRM uses Google OAuth for authentication. You log in with your existing Google account, and the system automatically creates your user profile and associated Person record.

**Q: What happens to my data if I leave the organization?**
A: Your user account can be deactivated by administrators, but the contacts and data you created remain in the system for organizational continuity. Your Person record remains active for historical reference.

### Contact Management

**Q: What's the difference between a Person and a Church in the system?**
A: Both People and Churches are contacts, but they serve different purposes:
- **Person**: Individual contacts with personal information, church relationships, and individual pipeline tracking
- **Church**: Organizational contacts with institutional information, leadership details, and church-specific pipeline stages (including EN42)

**Q: Can one person be associated with multiple churches?**
A: Yes, people can have relationships with multiple churches through the ChurchMembership system. Each relationship can have different roles and status (active, inactive, former).

**Q: How do I avoid creating duplicate contacts?**
A: Always search for existing contacts before creating new ones. Use the search function with email addresses, names, or phone numbers. The system will show potential matches to help prevent duplicates.

**Q: Can I import my existing contacts from another system?**
A: Contact your system administrator about data import capabilities. The system has import tools, but they typically require administrative access to ensure data quality and prevent duplicates.

### Pipeline Management

**Q: What do the different pipeline stages mean?**
A: The standard pipeline stages represent relationship progression:
- **Promotion**: Initial awareness and interest
- **Information**: Detailed information sharing and education
- **Invitation**: Formal invitation to participate
- **Confirmation**: Commitment finalization
- **Automation**: Ongoing relationship management
- **EN42** (Churches only): Enhanced engagement level

**Q: Can I skip pipeline stages?**
A: While technically possible, it's not recommended. The pipeline stages represent a logical progression. Skipping stages may result in missed opportunities or inadequate relationship development.

**Q: How often should I update pipeline stages?**
A: Update pipeline stages after significant interactions or developments. This could be after meetings, email exchanges, decisions, or any activity that represents progress in the relationship.

**Q: What happens if a contact doesn't progress through the pipeline?**
A: Contacts can remain in any stage indefinitely. Use notes and task reminders to document reasons for delays and plan follow-up activities. Some contacts may naturally exit the pipeline if they're no longer interested or appropriate.

### Task Management

**Q: Can I assign tasks to people in other offices?**
A: This depends on your role:
- **Super Admin**: Can assign tasks across all offices
- **Office Admin**: Can assign within their office(s)
- **Standard User**: Can typically only assign within their office
- **Limited User**: Usually cannot assign tasks to others

**Q: What happens to recurring tasks when I'm away?**
A: Recurring tasks continue to generate according to their schedule. If you'll be away for extended periods, consider:
- Temporarily disabling recurring task templates
- Asking colleagues to cover critical recurring tasks
- Adjusting recurrence patterns for your schedule

**Q: Can I modify a recurring task after it's created?**
A: You can modify individual task instances, but changes to the recurring template only affect future tasks. If you need to modify all future occurrences, edit the recurring task template.

### Email Integration

**Q: Will connecting Gmail give the CRM access to all my emails?**
A: By default, the system uses "Contacts Only" sync mode, which only syncs emails to/from people in your CRM. You can choose to sync all emails, but this is not recommended for privacy and performance reasons.

**Q: Can I disconnect Gmail integration without losing data?**
A: Yes, disconnecting Gmail stops future synchronization but doesn't delete emails already synced to the CRM. However, you won't be able to send emails through the CRM until you reconnect.

**Q: Why aren't all my emails syncing to the CRM?**
A: Check your sync settings:
- **Contacts Only mode**: Only emails from CRM contacts sync
- **Date Range**: May only sync recent emails
- **Contact Matching**: Ensure contact email addresses are accurate
- **Sync Frequency**: May not have synced recently

### Permissions and Access

**Q: Why can't I see all the contacts in the system?**
A: Your data access depends on your role and office assignment:
- **Super Admin**: Sees all data across all offices
- **Office Admin**: Sees all data within assigned office(s)
- **Standard User**: Sees their own contacts plus office churches
- **Limited User**: Has read-only access to assigned data

**Q: Can I change my own user role?**
A: No, user roles must be changed by administrators:
- **Super Admin**: Can change any user's role
- **Office Admin**: Can change roles within their office (except cannot create Super Admins)
- **Standard/Limited Users**: Cannot change roles

**Q: What if I need access to data in another office?**

A: System administrators monitor Google API changes and update the system as needed. You may occasionally need to re-authorize permissions when Google updates their systems.
