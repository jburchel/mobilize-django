FIX: Enable View Mode toggle for office admins on People page

- Fixed hardcoded role assignment in CustomAuthMiddleware that was preventing office admins from seeing the View Mode toggle
- Updated AuthenticatedUser class to query User model for actual role instead of hardcoding roles
- Added proper error handling for missing users with fallback to standard_user
- Office admins will now see toggle with "My Office"/"My People Only" options
- Maintains backward compatibility for super admins and standard users

Fixes issue where only j.burchel@crossoverglobal.net got super_admin role while all other users were hardcoded as standard_user, preventing office admins from accessing their proper permissions.
