# Native SMS Logging Feature

## Overview

The Native SMS Logging feature allows users to manually log SMS messages sent or received through their phone's native messaging app **without requiring any external services**. This solution addresses the need to track SMS communications with contacts in the database while using the phone's built-in messaging capabilities.

## Key Features

### ✅ **No External Services Required**
- No need to sign up for Twilio, TextMagic, or any other SMS service
- Uses the phone's native messaging app
- Completely self-contained within the Django application

### ✅ **Automatic Contact Recognition**
- Automatically identifies contacts from the database by phone number
- Supports multiple phone number formats (with/without country codes, different formatting)
- Matches contacts even with differently formatted phone numbers

### ✅ **User Association**
- Each logged SMS is associated with the user who logged it
- Maintains user context for reporting and filtering
- Proper office-level data isolation

### ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**
- Supports both incoming and outgoing SMS messages
- Stores complete message content and metadata
- Tracks timestamps and communication history

### ✅ **Mobile-Friendly Interface**
- Responsive design works on all devices
- Touch-friendly interface for mobile users
- Quick logging workflow for efficient data entry

## How It Works

### 1. **Manual SMS Logging Process**
1. User receives or sends an SMS through their phone's native messaging app
2. User opens the Mobilize CRM web interface
3. User navigates to Communications → SMS Logging
4. User enters the phone number and message content
5. System automatically finds matching contacts
6. User confirms and logs the SMS

### 2. **Contact Matching Algorithm**
The system uses a sophisticated phone number matching algorithm:
- Exact match with stored phone numbers
- Normalization to E.164 format (+1XXXXXXXXXX)
- Fuzzy matching with various formatting patterns
- Supports US and international phone numbers

### 3. **Data Storage**
SMS messages are stored in the existing `Communication` model:
- `type`: "Text Message"
- `direction`: "inbound" or "outbound"
- `message`: SMS content
- `person`/`church`: Linked contact (if found)
- `user`: User who logged the SMS
- `office`: User's office for data isolation

    content=message_body,
    subject=f"SMS from/to {contact_name|phone_number}",
    date=timestamp.date(),
    date_sent=timestamp,
    person=person_object,          # If contact is a person
    church=church_object,          # If contact is a church
    user=request.user,             # User who logged the SMS
    office=request.user.office,    # User's office
    status="received|sent",
    external_id=f"native_sms_{timestamp}"
